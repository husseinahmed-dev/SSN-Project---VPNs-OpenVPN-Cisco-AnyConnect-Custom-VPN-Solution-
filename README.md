# SSN-Project---VPNs-OpenVPN-Cisco-AnyConnect-Custom-VPN-Solution-
With the rise of remote work and hybrid work environments, it is not easy to access remote resources safely over networks we do not trust, especially after the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19. Companies started utilizing remote work and hybrid work schedules. They accelerated their digital transformation strategies by migrating to the cloud and allowing employees easy remote access. There are many VPN vendors, and competition in this market is rising rapidly. In this study, the three most popular VPN options for medium-sized to large businesses and corporations will be looked at and compared. How easy is it to integrate with the infrastructure and company environment, allowing seamless user authentication via Active Directory and LDAP. We will compare the difficulty of the implementation, features, costs, integration, security, and availability. In addition, the more digitalized our lives become, as we rely more and more on technology in our daily lives, the greater the chance that our personal information may become compromised. From Internet Service Providers to companies gathering data to monetize and/or sell to hackers attempting to steal personal details for malicious purposes to companies that use such data for targeted advertising and data gathering, everyone and everything we interact with online may be tracking us. A virtual private network, or VPN, protects user data connections and hides where the user is. We can use VPN to browse the web without fear of being tracked. We will briefly discuss what a VPN is, how it functions, how to establish it, and the many modes and security features of VPNs. For the implementation part, we will be implementing three private networks across three separate regions (the first network in IRAQ—Erbil, the second network in Kazan—Innopolis, and the third network on AWS—Frankfurt) and connecting them using the provided solutions and services. The network topology for the OpenVPN deployment we will be using is shown in Figure 1.
